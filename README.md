Final Project for Web Design With Client Side Scripting IT0043
2nd Year 1st Term 2019

PROJECT CONCEPT: RESPONSIVE BUSINESS WEBSITE INDIVIDUAL PROJECT 


INTRODUCTION:  For this project, the term website redesign refers to the complete website overhaul in terms of user interface. The website that you will create should be treated as your own. 
Therefore, the website contents will be personalized but make sure to maintain the business information.  

PAGES TO BE CREATED:  Homepage – This is the page most people will see first, and as such, it should tell everyone who you are and what your company does. (25POINTS) 
					  About Page – This page should give a brief summary of who you are, your company history and what isolates you from the competition. (15POINTS) 
					  Product/Service Page – Offer details about the products/services you sell/offer. You may outline it using short descriptions with links to individual page. (20POINTS) 
					  FAQ Page – The FAQ page is your space to answer the most frequent questions you are asked. This will tell everyone – on one page – what they need to know. (10POINTS) 
					  Testimonials Page – This is your chance to show off positive reviews your company has received. Where possible, include photos and contact info of the author. (10POINTS) 
					  Contact Page – Your contact page show potential customers all the ways they can get in touch with you. You may use a contact form and display contact details. (10POINTS) 
					  Privacy Policy Page – A privacy policy is a must for every website, as it lets the visitor to your website know what you’ll do with the personal information they give you. (10POINTS)
					 
					 
GUIDELINES: 1. The website should be responsive. Meaning, the redesign website should look good in any device. You may use a framework like Bootstrap or a grid system like Unsemantic. 
			2. Choose only the businesses that are known in the Philippines. For example, SM Malls, Jollibee, Ayala Land, PLDT, Banco De Oro, Chowking, etc. 
			3. You must not download a template from the Internet. Furthermore, it is recommended that you use only HTML and CSS as it is the focus of the subject. 
			4. You may either use the web design layout techniques and design trends discussed previously as a reference for redesigning the website or freely design the website. 
			5. If the business doesn’t have a website, then you may create one for them. If they have an existing website, try to stay away from their current design. Moreover, 
			   if a page (as stated above) does not exist on their website, then you should create your own version of it. 
			6. Finally, and the most important of all, the website should be stored in a web server so that anyone can access it. You may use a free web hosting like 000webhost.com. 
			   Name your homepage as “index.html” so that it will be treated as the root page or homepage.
